# This program conunts pairs of numbers in binary representation, that differ by exactly one digit.
## Is is capable of large input size, i.e. n = 131072 numbers and l = 1024 bits for each number. The program is designed to run on a CUDA-capable GPU only. Time complexity is O(n*l) only. Final project for GPU computing course at WUT.
